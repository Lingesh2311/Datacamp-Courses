Chapter 2 contains details on the **Gaussian Mixture Models**, **Hierarchical clustering**, **t-SNE**

### Gaussian Mixture Models
It attempts to find a mixture of multi-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions that best model any dataset as input. In the simplest case, GMM's can be used to finding clusters in the same manner as k-means


### Visualization Hierarchies
- Hierarchical clustering. Think of **dendrogram**. Use `Scipy`.
- Clusters are read bottom up
- t-SNE
